Tools for parsing C++ and creating bindings and serialization libraries.  

A collection of tools built with LuaJIT, Clang, and SQLite for parsing C++, building a database, and then generating code for serialization and bindings to scripting languages.  Tools are all written in lua.  Bindings to clang and sqlite3 use LuaJIT's FFI.
